            Charles Darwin transformed the way we understand the natural world
            with ideas that, in his day, were nothing short of revolutionary. He
            gave us insight into the fantastic diversity of life on Earth and
            its origins, including our own as a species.

            Darwin's theory of evolution remains fundamental to the study of the
            natural world. Darwin changed not only the way we see all organisms,
            but also the way we see ourselves.

                Born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Charles Robert Darwin was
                fascinated by the natural world from a young age. Growing up he
                was an avid reader of nature books and devoted his spare time to
                exploring the fields and woodlands around his home, collecting
                plants and insects.

                Charles enrolled in medical school at the University of
                Edinburgh, but he found lectures dull and surgery distressing,
                so he proved to be more interested in natural history than in
                his regular studies.

                Darwin accepted an offer to embark on a five-year voyage aboard
                <abbr title="Her or His Majesty's Ship">HMS</abbr> Beagle. The
                journey would change both his life and the trajectory of Western
                scientific thinking. On his travels Darwin collected plants,
                animals and took copious field notes, which provided the
                evidence he needed to develop his remarkable theory.

                He returned to England. A highly methodical scholar, Darwin
                spent many years comparing and analysing specimens before
                finally declaring that evolution occurs by a process of natural
                selection.

                After several rejections, Darwin finally accepted the post of
                Secretary of the Geological Society. A Few months later he was

                Darwin published his book "On the Origin of Species by Means of

                best evidence-based explanation for the diversity and complexity
                of life on Earth.

                The second Darwin's book on the evolutionary theory was out.
                "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex" fuelled
                even greater debate as it suggested that humans descended from
                apes.
